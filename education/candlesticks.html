    <h2>What Is a Candlestick?</h2>
    <p>
      A candlestick shows four things:
      <strong>Open, High, Low, and Close</strong>.
      It tells you who controlled the market — buyers or sellers.

    <h2>Important Candlestick Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      As a beginner, focus on a few strong patterns.
      More patterns = more confusion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Bullish Engulfing</h2>
    <p>
      A large bullish candle completely engulfs the previous bearish candle.
      It often signals buyers taking control.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Bearish Engulfing</h2>
    <p>
      A strong bearish candle engulfs a bullish candle.
      It often signals selling pressure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Pin Bar (Rejection Candle)</h2>
    <p>
      A candle with a long wick and small body.
      Shows strong rejection from a price level.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Common Beginner Mistake</h2>
    <p>
      Candlestick patterns are NOT entry signals alone.
      Always combine them with:
      <strong>levels, trend, or sessions</strong>.
